# Change-Detection-in-Multi-Temporal-Images
This implementation involves a change detection task using a sequence of multi-temporal RGB images. The goal of this project is to process a time-series of images, apply Fourier-based low-frequency masking to remove high-frequency noise, and then use a deep learning model to generate a binary change map indicating regions of change over time.
